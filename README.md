# Calculator Project

This project is a simple calculator application implemented in Java, which supports basic arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication.

## Features

- **Addition**: You can add two numbers or multiple numbers.
- **Multiplication**: You can multiply two numbers or multiple numbers.

## Structure

### Main Class

The `Main` class contains the following methods:

- **add(int a, int b)**: Adds two integers.
- **add(int... var)**: Adds multiple integers.
- **multiply(int a, int b)**: Multiplies two integers.
- **multiply(int... var)**: Multiplies multiple integers.

### CalculatorTest Class

The `CalculatorTest` class contains unit tests for the methods in the `Main` class. It uses JUnit to validate the functionality of the add and multiply methods.

- **testAddingTwoNumbers()**: Tests the addition of two numbers.
- **testAddingManyNumbers()**: Tests the addition of multiple numbers.
- **testMultiplyingTwoNumbers()**: Tests the multiplication of two numbers.

## Requirements
